# Restify
The restify library aims to simplify and speed up development for REST based clients in C#.

What has this library to offer:

* Object to HTTP Request mapping (no method mapping)
* Authenticating requests
* HTTP request and/or response logging
* (smart) HTTP response caching
* Fluent interface for building the desired configuration (e.g. the request mapping)
* Extensiblity through dependency injection
